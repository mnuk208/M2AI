# M2AI
M2AI (Pronounced as M Squared AI) — Mehar Memorial Artificial Intelligence —is a startup founded by Dr. Muhammad Naeem and Dr. Asim Shahzad, both professors at the Department of Computer Science, Abbottabad University of Science & Technology. 
M2AI will comprise numerous AI initiatives/projects that we will initiate/execute at our institute, Abbottabad University of Science & Technology, with our team. 
We are currently working on an AI Detection Web App named AI-CheckMate, and it will be hosted at jhotpPakro.ai shortly.
AI-CheckMate consists of two Modes: 1) Detect Text Mode; 2) Humanise Text Mode.
AI-CheckMate might input text by copy/paste or an input file (txt, docx, ppt, pdf) in both modes.
This will generate AI likeliness and Human likeliness after calculating entropy, perplexity, and burstiness of the text in Detect Text Mode.
Output is shown in the form of a pie chart, bar graphs, and gauge meters.
While in Humanise Mode, this app provides users with the opportunity to input text that will be humanised.
Then, Humanised Mode humanises the text based on fin-tuned LLMs for text humanisations.
