# M2AI
M2AI (Pronounced as M Squared AI)--Mehar Memorial Artificial Intelligence-- is my startup. M2AI contains my AI projects, which I will do at my institute, Abbottabad University of Science & Technology, with my team. 
We are currently working on an AI Detection Web App named AI-CheckMate.
AI-CheckMate will input text by copy/paste or an input file (txt, docx, ppt, pdf)
This will generate AI likeliness and Human likeliness after calculating entropy, perplexity, and burstiness of the text.
Output is shown in the form of a pie chart, bar graphs, and gauge meters.
